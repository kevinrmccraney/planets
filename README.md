# Planets
### Overview

[**Planets**](http://kevinrmccraney.github.io/planets/) is an experiment with the [d3.jsI](https://d3.org) library for visualization. The core of the project is based on [a tutorial by Joanne Cheng](https://github.com/joannecheng/introduction_to_d3). Clicking a planet will scale its size, while hovering over a planet will give you some basic facts. It was built over three or four days, and is my second JavaScript project.
